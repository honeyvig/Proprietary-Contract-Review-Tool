# Proprietary-Contract-Review-Tool
Build a proprietary tool in a closed loop environment that can do contract reviews for a specific industry to identify contract clauses and deliver back insights on the meaning of these contract terms. We need the tool to scan the documents, OCR where applicable, and identify clauses and terms like cancellation fees, liquidated damages, personal guarantees, and other covenants that contracts hold our clients to. We will need to continue to train this tool with new contracts and highlights to these clauses so it can become more intelligent on the topic.
=============
Python code framework for developing a proprietary contract review tool. This tool uses OCR for scanning documents, natural language processing (NLP) for clause extraction, and a machine learning model to identify contract terms such as cancellation fees, liquidated damages, personal guarantees, and other covenants. It also includes functionality for continuous model training to improve accuracy over time.
Python Framework for Contract Review Tool
Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

pip install pytesseract pdf2image nltk spacy transformers sklearn pandas

1. OCR for Document Scanning

Use Tesseract OCR to process scanned documents into text.

import pytesseract
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
import os

# Configure Tesseract OCR
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/path/to/tesseract'

# Convert PDF to text
def pdf_to_text(pdf_path):
    pages = convert_from_path(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in pages:
        text += pytesseract.image_to_string(page)
    return text

# Save extracted text
def save_extracted_text(pdf_path, output_path):
    text = pdf_to_text(pdf_path)
    with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(text)
    print(f"Extracted text saved to {output_path}.")

2. NLP for Clause Identification

Leverage NLP to extract predefined clauses using rule-based or AI-based methods.

import re
import spacy

# Load pre-trained SpaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define regex patterns for clause identification
patterns = {
    "cancellation_fees": r"(cancellation fees?|termination penalties?)",
    "liquidated_damages": r"(liquidated damages?|specified compensation)",
    "personal_guarantees": r"(personal guarantees?|surety agreements?)",
    "covenants": r"(covenants?|binding obligations)"
}

# Identify clauses in text
def identify_clauses(text):
    clauses = {}
    for clause, pattern in patterns.items():
        matches = re.findall(pattern, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
        clauses[clause] = matches if matches else "Not Found"
    return clauses

# Extract key clauses
def extract_clauses_from_text(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    clauses = identify_clauses(text)
    return clauses

3. Machine Learning for Clause Prediction

Build and train a custom model to improve clause identification.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# Prepare training data
def prepare_training_data(data_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(data_path)  # Load labeled dataset
    X = df['text']
    y = df['clause_type']
    return X, y

# Train a classification model
def train_clause_model(data_path, model_output_path):
    X, y = prepare_training_data(data_path)
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)

    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_vectorized, y)

    # Save model and vectorizer
    with open(model_output_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump((model, vectorizer), file)
    print("Model trained and saved.")

# Predict clauses using the trained model
def predict_clause(text, model_path):
    with open(model_path, 'rb') as file:
        model, vectorizer = pickle.load(file)
    
    X_vectorized = vectorizer.transform([text])
    prediction = model.predict(X_vectorized)
    return prediction

4. Continuous Model Training

Update the model with new data to improve accuracy.

def update_model(new_data_path, model_path):
    # Load the existing model and vectorizer
    with open(model_path, 'rb') as file:
        model, vectorizer = pickle.load(file)

    # Load new training data
    X_new, y_new = prepare_training_data(new_data_path)
    X_new_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_new)

    # Retrain the model
    model.fit(X_new_vectorized, y_new)

    # Save the updated model
    with open(model_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump((model, vectorizer), file)
    print("Model updated with new data.")

5. Insights Delivery

Generate a summary report of extracted clauses and insights.

def generate_insights_report(clauses, output_path):
    with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
        for clause, details in clauses.items():
            file.write(f"{clause.upper()}:\n")
            file.write(f"{details if details != 'Not Found' else 'No occurrences found.'}\n\n")
    print(f"Insights report saved to {output_path}.")

Example Workflow

    Extract Text from PDF:

pdf_path = "sample_contract.pdf"
text_path = "extracted_text.txt"
save_extracted_text(pdf_path, text_path)

Identify Clauses:

with open(text_path, 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()
clauses = extract_clauses_from_text(text)

Train or Predict Clauses:

# Train Model
train_clause_model("training_data.csv", "clause_model.pkl")

# Predict New Clauses
predicted_clause = predict_clause(text, "clause_model.pkl")
print(predicted_clause)

Generate Report:

    generate_insights_report(clauses, "insights_report.txt")

Features of the Tool

    OCR Processing: Converts scanned documents into readable text.
    Clause Extraction: Identifies specific clauses using NLP and regex.
    ML Model: Predicts and learns new clause patterns for accuracy improvement.
    Insights Reporting: Summarizes findings for end-users in an easy-to-read format.
